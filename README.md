# O₂ : Programming, reimagined.

O₂ is a programming language you will never be able to use. You'll see why.

## Development status

I'm still working on the language's design, which I assume will take a while. Don't expect it to be user friendly, because I'm about to cook up something $$\color{red}\text{diabolical}$$.

I also haven't yet decided whether to make this language interpreted or compiled to machine code. Obviously, compilation would be more difficult, but that's no excuse.

## Disclaimer

O₂ is a humorous [esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) and is currently under development. It is meant to be a more evil successor to my other esolang, [Agonize](https://github.com/agonizelang/agonize). Perhaps the only exciting thing about this language is that it's written in Rust as opposed to [Dart](https://dart.dev), so yay.
